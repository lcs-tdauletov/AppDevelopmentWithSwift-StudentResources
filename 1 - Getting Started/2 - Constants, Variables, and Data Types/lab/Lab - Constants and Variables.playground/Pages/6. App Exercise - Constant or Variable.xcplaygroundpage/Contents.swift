/*:
 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let name = "The daughter of Computer"
print("String suits the best because it's a rare situation when a person decides to actually change his/her name")
var age : Int  = 18
print("In the given context, the age criteria can be ambiguous, but I chose it to be a vatiable, because age is constantly changing")
let  numberOfStepsTakenToday = 9999
print("This one is ambivalent too, but at that particular day, The daughter of Computer onlu made a fixed number of steps")
let goalNumberOfSteps = 10000
let averageHeartRate = 200 // She's consistently stressed






/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
